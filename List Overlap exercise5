a = [i for i in range(1,11)]
b = [j for j in range(4,16)]
m=[]
for num in range(0,len(a)-1):

    if a[num] in b:

        if a[num] not in m:

            m.append(a[num])
print(a,"\n",b)
print(m)

used list comprehension and used if in and if not in 
it is kind of weird is looks like english language but its is okay
